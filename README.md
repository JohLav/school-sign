# Electronic Signature Application for Schools

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and developing an **electronic signature and administrative management application** tailored to the needs of schools. The platform enables teachers, parents, and administrators to securely and legally sign documents online, manage attendance sheets, define course schedules, and handle teacher-related tasksâ€”all accessible via a web browser.

## Launch Project

- Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JohLav/school-sign.git
```

- Go to the project directory and install dependencies:

```
$ cd school-sign && npm install
```

- Duplicate `.env.sample` and name it `.env` to associate your environment with security:

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://me:MyPa$$w0Rd@localhost:3306/school-sign?connection_limit=1"
```

- Create the database locally:

```
CREATE DATABASE `school-sign`;
```

- Generate the Prisma Client based on your schema:

```
npx prisma generate
```

- Seed the database with dummy data:

```
npx prisma db seed
```

<small>In case you need a complete database reset (drop db, create db, apply all migrations and generate prisma client): https://www.basedash.com/blog/how-to-reset-and-seed-a-prisma-database</small>

- To show the School Sign application window with your current build:

```
$ npm run dev
```
